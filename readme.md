1) Download it [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ryncmrfrd/pageination/master/dist/3.1.0/pageination-3.1.0.min.js).
    
2) Add some basic HTML.
    ```html
    <main id="wrapper">
        <section class="Page1">
            Page1
        </section>
        <section class="Page2">
            Page2
        </section>
        <section class="Page3">
            Page3
        </section>
    </main>
    ```
    
3) Sprinkle in a bit of JS.
    ```js
        new pageination("#wrapper")
    ```
